# E-learning Project - Online Learning Platform

This project was developed as part of our university coursework, undertaken as a group assignment. It's an e-learning platform designed to facilitate online education. We primarily used HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP (employing the MVC design pattern) to build this web application.

# My Role in the Project

In this project, my primary role was to focus on backend development, specifically on the interface with the database and the management of models in the MVC pattern. I worked on creating, updating, and deleting data, as well as managing information related to courses, teachers, and students.
